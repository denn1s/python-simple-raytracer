This is the source code repository for the raytracer renderer that will be implemented by the computer science students at uvg.edu.gt.

The goal of this project is to render a single 3D scene without using any external libraries (very few exceptions will be allowed)

**Examples for the lectures will be provided in python a week after each lesson.**
